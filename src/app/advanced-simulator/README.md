## `Advanced simulator plugin`

A feature that allows you to create simulators with the help of Claude AI. You only need to go to the Devicemanagement > Simulators and see a new tab called "Add advanced simulator". If you provide then an Claude API Key and a short use-case of your simulator, the AI will generate a set of instructions that fit your simulation use-case.

 > **Important**: You need a Anthropic Claude API Key to use this feature.
